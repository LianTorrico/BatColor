# BatColor
.bat file to change prompt color
## How does it work
This "program" requires both of the .bat files to be in the same  dir, index calls colorc in order to change color to the cmd, for some reason, batch script doesn't let you change color in the same code.
For that reason we'll use 2 files, one is for the selection while the other one is to actually change the color of the cmd.
